# NASA-API
An application I made to further improve my networking ability. I used third party pods such as Moya, Alamofire, Kingfisher while developing. It has a TabBar inside, and you have 3 tab options in it; each representing a different rover. These are divided into Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit. When you select one of the tabs, photos appear. When you click on the photo, a pop-up with many details opens; what camera that photo belongs to, when it was taken, etc. There is a filter button at the top right. Thanks to this button, you can list the photos according to the camera you want.
